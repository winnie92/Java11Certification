# import-and-packaging

## Compile and Run

```
javac -d <dir> <package/something.java>
java -cp <dir> <package.className>
```
## Imports
- Need to use 'static' to import static members
- java.lang is implicitly used
- conflicts: use full name
- either import a class, or import a member, or import every member using *

## Quiz
- package need to be the first line, if not, error thrown in the line with 'package'
